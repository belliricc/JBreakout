# JBreakout
Breakout clone made in Java and Swing, done some time ago as an exercise.
## Features (if you can call them so)
- Coded using the [MVC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93controller) and [singleton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singleton_pattern) design patterns
- UI components realized in Swing, using NetBeans's graphical editor for layout
- Sound effects!
- Fully scalable window; resize the window however you want
- Customizable player name and permanent highscores board
- Games can be saved to (and resumed from) a file
- Custom level-to-file format; levels can be easily built using simple scripts
